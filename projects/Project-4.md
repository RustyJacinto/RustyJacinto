## The Project ##
  Before the start of the new school semester, I had to go through quite the struggle of moving a lot of my household items from Ewa to Manoa. Although I did not really have to bring with me, the travelling distance is what made it quite the challenge. However, when I got settled in, I was able to have a room all to myself for the first time. That is when I go on to build my first gaming set-up over a span of some months. Here is how it looks so far!
