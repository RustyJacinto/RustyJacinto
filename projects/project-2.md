summary: I make tunes that I thought were cool.

Music has always been one of favorite past times. Most of the times I just just enjoy listening to it, but every once in a while when a stroke of inspiration hits me, I attempt to make my own tunes (No, I don't sing). I usually like to make electronic music and experiment with all types of sounds. I mainly use FL Studio for creating most of my tracks, but to be honest, I do not even know what I am doing half of the times! I said I experiment with all types of sounds, but in actuallity, I am just flipping random knobs all over the place. However, I some how find a way to create a sound that I like. 

The pictures below is an example of some of my projects. Some projects can take as long as a couple days to make (sample 1), but others can take months (sample 2)!
