## Gaming ##
  I have always been an avid gamer since childhood. I try to find room in my schedule to where I can get a good amount of hours to decdicate gaming too because it is something that I just enjoy a lot. I have dabbled in about every single genre (except horror, I am too much of a sissy) and can not really say that I dislike any of them. If I did have to pick favorites though, I would say I enjoy fighting, puzzle, strategy, and rhythme games the most.

## Anime ##
  Although I do not exactly watch anime as much (because of gaming), it is still one of those hobbies that I like to enjoy every once in a while. Whenever I find a good show, I might end up just binging an entire season of it. The only problem is, I can sometimes have a hard time to have the focus and patience to watch them, which is why I prefer gaming more. My favorite genres in anime are romance, action, thriller, and mystery.

## Other Stuff ##
  I do not exactly do these other activities that much, but some other stuff I dabble is music. Whenever I get an idea popping, I like to translate it via electronically. I am not exactly a professional when it comes to these types of things, but I still have fun with it. It is just unfortunate that I can run out of ideas pretty fast.
