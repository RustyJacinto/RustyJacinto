## What makes a question... good?

  There has been saying that you probably heard more than once that goes, "there is no such thing as dumb questions". Although this essay is specifically about asking smart questions, I would like to say that I agree with this statement. However, there are magnitudes about how to ask question that helps the people you are asking be able to solve a problem that you are experiencing. Here, we will be exploring ways on how to ask a questions on StackOverflow so you can recieve the maximum amount of help from fellow programmers.

## Pinpoint the problem!

  One way to get people to invest some time into your problem is to ask questions that are precise. Do you know those types of people in your math class that would ask the smartest person in class to show them the full process of a math problem? Do NOT be that type of person. Rather, tell them where you are having trouble and describe the methods you have already tried for a solution. You want the people you are asking to help solve a problem, not give you a lesson. This helps eliminate options and answers the listener could tell you and can help you come reach a solution much faster. This also saves the listener the trouble of going on a goose chase about how you want your problem solved.
  
## Choose a topic that is not too trivial

  StackOverflow is going to be where we will be posting these questions, so it is in your best interest not to post anything that you could find within minutes. It is recommended that you select a topic that is sophisticated enough to where it is out of the bounds of common or standard knowledge.
  
```
Q: I have an array of integers, and I'm using the .push() method to add elements to it. 

Is there a simple way to remove a specific element from an array? The equivalent of something like array.remove(int);.
```

This here is an example of one those trivial questions. Although the answer to this question has helped many, you could have found the same answer on the developer's website for the programming language that you are using. Asking these types of questions can sometimes even lead to you getting ignored or even some snarky comments. 

## Be Detailed

  Describing the situation as much as possible helps viewers visualize your whole process and makes it easier to identify where your problem is. Giving snippets of your code and describing its function and purpose helps viewers reach levels of understanding much faster and will help you reach an answer quicker.

```
Q: I already have a 404 handler in the SPA which works. The problem here is that Google for example links to old pages that no longer exist. While the user will see a custom 404 component, google will get, I assume, a 200 OK and continue to think the page is valid.

{
  path: '*',
  name: 'not-found',
  component: NotFound // 404
}

I have the server re-route to / and let vue handle the routing using History:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
 
It's a standard Vue CLI install with a php backend. PHP is currently only used for API calls.

Is there a way to have the server return a 404 status code in this scenario?
```

I have no idea what he is talking about within this question, considering that I am only a beginner programmer at the time of writing this essay, but this is a more refined example of how to ask a question. The questioner gives the run down of what his code does, gives snippets, and then ends it off with a problem he is having.

## Conclusion

  When relying on others to answer a question that you have, it best to give them as much useful information as possible in order to give them an easier time to help you. Help them help you, as some would say. Eventually, you will be put in a scenario where you have to answer someones question, and you might be tearing your hair out because they asked you in one of the most annoying ways possible. So now, take your curiosity to StackOVerflow and learn as much as you can! Just make sure when making a post, it is within the proper forum.
