## Introduction to the Course
  Going through the first 2 weeks of the course, I have come to a realization that this course is going to take a lot of work. And it is not in the sense where challenges will be very difficult, it is in the sense where you just need to be able to familiarize yourself with the concepts given to you and being able to incorporate it within a coding environment. The learning format being "atheltic" is kind of interesting, but yet understandable as the key to success in this course is mainly practice. There will be a lot to learn because of the intensity of the course, but it is more about being able to pace yourself throughout the semester. You are not expected to work hours on end in the class, but being able to get your hours in (even if it is just 1 a day!) is crucial!

## Introduction to Javascript
  Javascript is quite a interesting coding language as it a very loose language. What I mean by this is the language is not strict when it comes to assigning datatypes to variables. In Java, variables were always given a datatype the moment they are created, but in JavaScript, they can be whatever they want. You just "let" the variables exist and you can put any object, value, etc within them. This can be a benefit as it passes through many of the redundancies of always labeling your variable types, it also comes with its cons. More specifically, it requires you to be cautious and very specific when it comes to handelling your vairables. However, with proper coding style and conventions, this should be a problem that is easy to tackle.
  
## Expectations of the Course  
  There are many of things I am looking forward to in this course. I want to learn as much I can when it comes to coding and software engineering. Along the way, I expect to gain or improve on other skills such as time anagement (ESPECIALLY!), cooperating with others, etc. I feel as if these skills will be able to get me far in the future, and I hope I will be able to succeed this semester!
  
## Final Thoughts
  I am looking forward to the semester. I hope this journey has me traverse over great distances!
